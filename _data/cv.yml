      description:
        - Developed and implemented alternative inventory-management strategies and spoil controls to identify and generate more opportunities through stimulating demand and driving revenue growth. For the 2023 fiscal year, this implementation generated more than ten million dollars on year-over-year revenue growth for all assigned routes and despite fleet constraints. 
          <br>
          <br>
        - Developed statistical and data-reporting tools for a continuous and more effective oversight of strategies and spoil controls’ performance in order to avoid revenue dilution and inventory spoilage.
          <br>
          <br>
        - Developed a framework for market analysis, demand forecast, and an inferential simulation for the creation and implementation of mapping logic for a new pricing and inventory structure, preventing disruption in revenue management.
          <br>
          <br>
        - Improved existing data visualization tools and created a new data analysis frame that includes more detailed information on every assigned train and route, such as sectional and directional analysis, time series analysis, among others for enhancing analytical capabilities and reducing data bias and turning them into unbiased business decisions.
          <br>
          <br>
        - Proactive participation on evaluating and formulating recommendations of current business practices and systems, such as recommendations for the Amtrak website, the new Revenue Management System, as well as identifying an existing bias in the performance indicators for assigned Midwest routes.
